## Dashboard PowerBI

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance for Blinkit, covering metrics like total sales, item types, fat content, outlet size, and location type. Using DAX,
slicers, drill-downs, and custom visuals, the dashboard enables quick identification of patterns and performance trends across five outlet types from 2010â€“2022.
